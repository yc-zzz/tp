---

### Sorting Transactions: `sort`
Displays transactions sorted by the specified criterion. The underlying list order is **not changed** — this is a display-only operation.

**Format**: `sort by/CRITERIA`

**Valid criteria (case-insensitive):**
- `date` — ascending (earliest first)
- `amount` — descending (largest first)
- `category` — alphabetical A–Z (case-insensitive)

**Examples**:

---

### Deleting a Transaction: `delete`
Deletes the transaction at the specified index in the displayed list.

**Format**: `delete ENTRY_INDEX`

**Examples**:
- `delete 3` Deletes the 3rd transaction in the list.

> [NOTE]
> The index must be a valid positive integer corresponding to an existing transaction.
---

### Editing a Transaction: `edit`
Replaces an existing transaction at the specified index with new values.
All fields must be provided — the edit replaces the entire transaction, not individual fields.

**Format**: `edit ENTRY_INDEX CATEGORY/PRICE [desc/DESCRIPTION] [d/YYYY-MM-DD]`

> [NOTE]
> Use `list` first to confirm the index of the transaction you want to edit. The edit can be reversed with `undo`.

> ⚠️ **Caution:** editing a transaction to another from income to expense and vice versa is not allowed.
---

### Undoing an Action: `undo`
Reverses the last mutating command (`add`, `delete`, or `edit`). Can be called repeatedly to step back through history.

**Format**: `undo`

**Examples**:
- `undo` — reverses the last add, delete, or edit operation.

> [NOTE]
> Undo history is reset when you exit the application. Only `add`, `delete`, and `edit` are undoable.

---

### Redoing an Action: `redo`
Re-applies the last undone action. Only available immediately after an `undo`.

**Format**: `redo`

**Examples**:
- `redo` — re-applies the last undone operation.

> [NOTE]
> Performing any new mutating command (`add`/`delete`/`edit`) after an `undo` clears the redo history.

---

### Managing your Budget: `budget`
Allows you to set a monthly budget and check your current budget usage.

**Format**:
- `budget set AMOUNT`
- `budget status`

**Examples**:
- `budget set 1000` Sets your monthly budget to $1000.

> [NOTE]
> Budget usage is calculated using expense transactions from the current month only.
---

### Viewing Spending Statistics: `stats`
Displays spending analytics for recorded transactions.

The statistics include:
- total income
- total expense
- highest expense
- lowest expense
- highest income
- most frequent expense category
- average spending per category
- spending trend
- budget usage percentage

**Format**: `stats`

**Examples**:
- `stats` Displays the full statistics summary for all recorded transactions.

> [NOTE]
> General statistics are based on all overall recorded transactions over the earliest transactions to the latest,
> while budget usage is based on the current month's expenses.
---
### Managing Custom Categories: `category`
Allows you to create and manage your own expense categories beyond the 7 built-in ones.
Custom categories are saved automatically and available across sessions.

**Format**:
- `category add/NAME`
- `category remove/NAME`
- `category list`

**Rules for category names**:
- Must contain only letters, digits, hyphens (`-`), or underscores (`_`)
- No spaces or special characters allowed
- Names are case-insensitive (`Groceries` and `groceries` are treated as the same)

**Examples**:
- `category add/groceries` — creates a new custom category called "groceries"
- `category remove/groceries` — deletes the custom category "groceries"
- `category list` — lists all available expense categories, built-in and custom

> [NOTE]
> Built-in categories (`food`, `transport`, `utilities`, `education`, `rent`, `medical`, `misc`) cannot be removed.
> A category cannot be removed if it is currently used by an existing transaction — delete those transactions first.
> Once a custom category is added, it can be used with `add` and `edit` just like a built-in category.
---

### Adding a Recurring Transaction: `add ... rec/FREQUENCY`
Creates a recurring transaction template. MoneyBagProMax will automatically generate the corresponding expense or income entries on startup and when you run `gen-rec`, covering all due dates since the last generation.

**Format**: `add [category]/PRICE [desc/DESCRIPTION] [d/YYYY-MM-DD] rec/FREQUENCY`

- `FREQUENCY` must be one of: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` (case-insensitive)
- `d/YYYY-MM-DD` sets the start date; defaults to today if omitted
- The category determines whether the entry is an expense or income (same valid categories as `add`)
> [NOTE]
> For valid expense and income categories, see [Adding an Expense](#adding-an-expense-add-expense-category) and [Adding an Income](#adding-an-income-add-income-category).

**Examples**:
- `add food/10 desc/lunch rec/daily` — Creates a daily $10 lunch expense template starting today.
- `add salary/3000 desc/monthly-pay d/2026-04-01 rec/monthly` — Creates a monthly $3000 income template starting 2026-04-01.
---

### Listing Recurring Transactions: `list-rec`
Displays all stored recurring transaction templates with their index, frequency, amount, category, description, and start date.

**Format**: `list-rec`

**Examples**:
- `list-rec` — Lists all recurring transaction templates currently stored.

> [NOTE]
> If no recurring templates exist, the application will show an empty-list message.

---

### Deleting a Recurring Transaction: `delete-rec`
Removes a recurring transaction template by its index shown in `list-rec`. This does not affect transactions that have already been generated from the template.

**Format**: `delete-rec INDEX`

- `INDEX` is the 1-based index from `list-rec`

**Examples**:
- `delete-rec 2` — Deletes the second recurring template in the list.

---

### Generating Recurring Transactions: `gen-rec`
Generates all pending transaction entries for every recurring template, up to today's date. Skips any dates that have already been generated to prevent duplicates. Recurring transactions are also generated automatically each time the application starts.

**Format**: `gen-rec`

**Examples**:
- `gen-rec` — Generates all due recurring transactions for all templates.

> [NOTE]
> If all templates are up-to-date, no new transactions are added.

---

### Filtering Transactions: `filter`
Filters and displays only the transactions that fall within a specified date range.

**Format**: `filter from/YYYY-MM-DD to/YYYY-MM-DD`

**Examples**:
- `filter from/2026-01-01 to/2026-03-31` Displays all transactions from 1st January 2026 to 31st March 2026.

> [NOTE]
> 1. Both `from/` and `to/` are compulsory.
> 2. The `from/` date **cannot be** after the `to/` date. The application will throw an error.

---

### Exporting to CSV: `export-csv`
Exports all transactions to a `.csv` file for use in external tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

**Format**: `export-csv FILEPATH`

**CSV columns**: `date`, `type`, `category`, `description`, `amount`

**Examples**:
- `export-csv transactions.csv` Exports all transactions to `transactions.csv` in the current directory.
- `export-csv reports/june.csv` Exports to a `reports/` subfolder (relative to current directory).

> [NOTE]
> Use relative paths (e.g. `transactions.csv`) or absolute paths specific to your OS.
> Tilde (`~/`) expansion is not supported — use the full path instead.
> - **Windows**: `export-csv C:\Users\YourName\transactions.csv`
> - **macOS/Linux**: `export-csv /Users/YourName/transactions.csv`

> [NOTE]
> This is for external analysis only — the CSV cannot be reimported into MoneyBagProMax. For transferring data between devices, use `export-data` instead.

---

### Exporting Data File: `export-data`
Copies the internal data file to a location of your choice. Useful for backing up your data or transferring it to another device.

**Format**: `export-data FILEPATH`

**Examples**:
- `export-data backup/transactions.txt` Copies the data file to a `backup/` subfolder in the current directory.

> [NOTE]
> Use relative paths or absolute paths specific to your OS.
> Tilde (`~/`) expansion is not supported — use the full path instead.
> - **Windows**: `export-data C:\Users\YourName\backup\transactions.txt`
> - **macOS/Linux**: `export-data /Users/YourName/backup/transactions.txt`

> [NOTE]
> The exported file can be used to restore your data on another device. See the [FAQ](#faq) for transfer instructions.

---

### Viewing the Help List: `help`
Shows the various commands that are available to be used in the MoneyBagProMax application.
Will also show the format of the various commands.

**Format**: `help`

**Examples**:
- `help` Shows all available commands

---

### Exiting the Application: `exit`
Exits the MoneyBagProMax application.

**Format**: `exit`

**Examples**:
- `exit` Closes the application.

---

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Install the MoneyBagProMax application on the new computer and run it once to generate the default data files.
Then, copy all three data files from your previous computer into the `data/` folder on the new one, overwriting the generated files:
- `data/transactions.txt` — your recorded income and expense entries
- `data/categories.txt` — your custom expense categories
- `data/recurring.txt` — your recurring transaction templates
> [NOTE]
> All three files must be transferred together. Copying only `transactions.txt` will cause custom categories and recurring templates to be lost on the new device.

---

## Editing the Data File

MoneyBagProMax automatically saves your transaction data in three text files, all located in the `./data/` directory relative to where you run the program:
- `transactions.txt` — stores all recorded income and expense entries.
- `categories.txt` — stores your custom expense categories (created with `category add/NAME`).
- `recurring.txt` — stores your recurring transaction templates (created with `add ... rec/FREQUENCY`).

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Be cautious when editing these files directly, as there are guards against file corruption and improper formatting. Failure to pass these checks may cause errors or data loss when the application is next launched.

### File Formats

**transactions.txt** — each line follows the format:
`[TXN] | type=TYPE | category=CATEGORY | amount=AMOUNT | description=DESCRIPTION | date=YYYY-MM-DD`

The budget is stored as: `[BUDGET] | amount=AMOUNT`

Valid values: `type` must be `income` or `expense`; `amount` must be a positive number; `date` must be `YYYY-MM-DD`; `description` may be empty.

Example lines:
- `[BUDGET] | amount=1000.0`
- `[TXN] | type=expense | category=food | amount=12.5 | description=lunch | date=2026-03-25`
- `[TXN] | type=income | category=salary | amount=3000.0 | description=march pay | date=2026-03-01`

**recurring.txt** — each line follows the format:
`[REC] | category=CATEGORY | amount=AMOUNT | description=DESCRIPTION | frequency=FREQUENCY | startDate=YYYY-MM-DD | lastGeneratedDate=YYYY-MM-DD`

Valid values: `frequency` must be `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, or `MONTHLY`; use `null` for `lastGeneratedDate` if the template has never been generated.

**categories.txt** — each custom category is stored as a plain lowercase string on its own line, e.g. `groceries` or `dining-out`.

> [NOTE]
> Lines that cannot be parsed are skipped and a warning is shown on the next launch. Lines not beginning with `[TXN]`, `[BUDGET]`, or `[REC]` are ignored.
